        The Tomato is a concept web app project about a food brand. The
        challenge here was to create a clean user interface that is nice to look
        at and relatively easy to use for just about anyone. Of course, this UI
        was designed to be responsive and fit in across many different screen
        sizes.

      <p className="text-xl leading-normal text-neutral-900  ">
        This part of an upcoming web development project that will be developed
        in the near future where React with either Tailwind CSS or SCSS will be
        utilized to make this happen. For now, enjoy the preview of the concept
        with these designs that I made using Figma and Photoshop.
